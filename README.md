## The console 

The initial focus is on crafting a robust storage system. This powerful storage engine serves as a crucial abstraction layer between "My object" and the intricacies of their storage and persistence. Essentially, this means that when working with your console code, the command interpreter itself, as well as the future front-end and RestAPI components, you won't need to concern yourself with the specifics of how your objects are stored.

Moreover, this abstraction provides the flexibility to seamlessly switch between different storage types without the need for extensive updates throughout your codebase.

The console is designed to serve as a tool for validating and ensuring the functionality of this versatile storage engine.
